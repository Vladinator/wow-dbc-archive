I told Cableclamp dis is a bad omen. I've heard stories about de sirens. In zandali, we call dem ""bwon'tulak."" Death Singers. Terrible creatures.

I am blessed. I never encountered dem before in all my time flyin' over de seas. But now we're headin' for a place named after dem?

"Feels good to be back on de open air!

Never felt right after we all went on strike with Cableclamp. Her contractors weren't payin' any of us--her included! So she brought the Princess down. Eventually we went our own separate ways for a while.

But we be back and ready to fly! Ha ha!

Except Du'una. She's afraid of de bwon'tulak, which I don't blame her. 

We're sailin' right into stormy weathers, but Shango always watchin' over us in de storms!",,279769,0,0,0,256,0,4,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,0
