I look back upon our adventures together as if they happened yesterday. 

Several of my admirers informed me that you looked rather... sullen... when last we met. While I see no reason for such behavior when you had the pleasure of working with the world-renowned Johnny Awesome, I did feel a twang of... what was it... pity?

Being as such, I felt it appropriate to send you this tip as a token of my appreciation for your efforts. 

Do people still tip? If people do NOT still tip, please return all attachments to me at once, along with a small amount of coin to cover my shipping costs.

It is through your actions and heroism that the mail continues to flow successfully throughout Azeroth and beyond.

The events which first brought you here were orchestrated - I knew you were the only one that could save the post office from an undue end.

I cannot rely on you forever - the mail must be able to operate without your aid. I must ask you to help me orchestrate once more to guide more into these stamped halls to give me aid.

You never can fully trust a stone fiend. Stone fiends must obey our orders, but they are devilishly good at finding loopholes when they want to.

567,"To $p,

Thank you for sending an exhaustive report of your recent hunts.

Not all of them appear relevant to the Wild Hunt's current endeavors, but they are impressive regardless.

I held the line against an enraged eggtender from Gormhive today. Watcher Ver'lo got the killing blow with a perfectly aimed arrow from the balcony above.

It's a shame you weren't there to see it. You would've appreciated the accuracy of his shot.

Continue the hunt,
Hunt-Captain Korayn"
568,"To $p,

I won't contest the accuracy of your current tally of kills, as reported in your previous letter.

But I do find them suspiciously high. I suppose you are the Maw Walker...

Still, I enjoy our contests and will attempt to keep up with you.

I have recorded one-hundred thirty-eight killing blows since I received your previous letter, and have--

<Hunt-Captain Korayn's writing trails off the page.>

Beat that,
Hunt-Captain Korayn"
569,"$p, I received your letter in a rare moment of quiet here at Claw's Edge.

The tales of your recent adventures were most welcome, both to me and the few hunters and grovewardens recovering alongside me.

I hope you don't mind: I shared your stories with them. Your legend is growing faster than you might imagine.

There's no doubt that tales of the mighty Maw Walker will be told around Wild Hunt campfires for a long time in Ardenweald.

I am proud to be a part of your story.

Until we hunt together again,
Hunt-Captain Korayn"
570,"Dear $p,

I hope this letter eventually reaches you. I've learned to be wary of faeries offering to help, but this one brought a letter from you!

Or least a very good imitation of one...

Still, I think we know each other well enough by now to identify one another's writing style.

As to the content of your letter, I trust you know that my grove is always welcome to you. Many have found peace and safety here after troubles in their past, myself included.

Whenever you need respite from the heavy burdens of being the Maw Walker, you will always find it here in Hibernal Hollow.

Sincerely,
Aliothe"
571,"Dear $p,

Your previous letter was the talk of the grove.

Guardian Molan was impressed by the tales of your recent battles. He requests that you send more details, including sketches of the tactical positioning used during the fight.

Na'lor was breathless at the description of the vistas you witnessed on your travels. There is wanderlust in that one...

Taiba and the crafters are eager to inspect your new equipment the next time you visit. They hope to learn a thing or two while repairing it for you.

Your willingness to spread knowledge between the realms has inspired us all.

Thank you,
Aliothe"
572,"Dear $p,

Anima falls like stars in the grove as I write this letter to you. Dazzlewing weaves between them in the sky, giggling.

Teendynneetll remains still, but has not yet noticed that a single star has landed on their shoulder. Or perhaps, they do not mind.

It is moments like this that make the fighting worthwhile. Remember that as you strive toward your next endeavor.

From your previous letter, it sounds like it will be a most worthwhile one.

But as you walk your path and embrace your role as Maw Walker, do not forget to rest in the peaceful moments as well.

They remind us why we must fight.

In rest,

573,"Hey $p,

I was just trying to wake up Rury when your letter came.

Hours of my shouting at him couldn't get him to budge, but the moment he heard you'd wrote us a letter, he perked right up. Figures, heh.

Anyway, we all like the plan you're thinking of for the next Ember Court. Sounds like it'll be a blast!

We're going to get an invitation, I assume. It wouldn't be right to tease us with the details and then not ask us to come... right?

Right?!

Waiting for that invitation,
Choofa and the gang"
574,"I gotta make this one quick, $p.

I can't go into all the details, but let's just say that I MIGHT have squirreled away some leftover fireworks from the last few Ember Courts. And I MIGHT have decided to use them to scare the walnuts outta Lady Moonberry.

Now I'm on the run. Lady Moonberry swore to get me back real good, and she doesn't do halfway when it comes to pranks!

I'm hoping she thinks Rury did it. He'll be easy to catch!

Send more fireworks!
Choofa-on-the-run"
575,"Hey buddy!

I gotta say, your letter made me even more excited for the next Ember Court. My hype level is cranked to eleven!

So when's it gonna happen? Slanknen won't stop asking me about it, and Awool's giving me his go-to grumpy stare from across the grove.

To be honest, the stare is probably my fault, but Slanknen's curiosity isn't! You gotta give me some details to share with him.

Or better yet, swing by Tirna Vaal and bring us our invitation in person!

It'd be fun to see you.

Keep partying,
Choofa"

Not sure how long ago your letter arrived. Hopefully recent.

Found it under a pile of ingots. It was covered in grease.

Only fourteen words were still legible, and none of them in direct sequence.

I assume you included some new curio in the package. In which case, I'm certain I've already found it, disassembled it, and reassembled it at least once already.

It was no doubt illuminating.

Your friend,
Mikanikos"
577,"$p,

I seem to have forgotten where I was going or why I was going there. It was likely important.

I found your letter in my bag. Perhaps you know what I was doing?

Please send instructions.

Your friend,
Mikanikos"
578,"$p,

Great letter. Diagrams of relics and technology you have encountered recently on your travels are very appreciated.

I will memorize them before distributing them to the forgehands for further study and experimentation.

If I am not mistaken, one of the designs you sent will make a powerful new hat for Bron.

Will try soon.

Your friend,
Mikanikos

P.S. Bron says hello."
579,"To $p,

You must warn me before opening your letters with amusing anecdotes. I nearly cracked a smile in front of the other polemarches.

I am uncertain if you intended to convey a sense of sadness in your previous letter--perhaps I have misread it.

You have made tremendous progress in uniting the Shadowlands behind your Prince.

The heroes of our realms rally behind your banner as you charge ahead into the unknown.

P.S. Kleia wants you to know that she's proud of you too!"
587,"Dear $p,

I have wrestled the quill and parchment away from Pelagos so that I may be the one to write to you for once.

I am currently writing this note while flying in the air above him. He is making quite the scene down there trying to convince me to come down.

It is not my proudest moment, but it seemed the only way to ensure that I got to write to you for once.

And now that I have... I can't quite think of what to write...

I hope you're doing well. Come see us soon.

I received your letter, but not the shipment of Revendreth-sourced slimes and oozes that I am certain was meant to accompany it.

My experiments cannot wait, so I will have to move forward without them.

Would you kindly send a dredger with the lost shipments as soon as possible?

If there's a dredger you've been hoping to get rid of, send that one. It's a win-win!

Thanks in advance,

589,"$p,

I am afraid that Kevin intercepted your previous letter before I could read it. I see it bobbing around inside of his slime as I write this.

He seems reluctant to let me have it, and it's already mostly dissolved, so I'm going to let it go.

It has given me a tremendous new idea for an experimental slime, however...

Your teacher,
Plague Deviser Marileth

P.S. Kevin looks happier now. It must've been a very kind letter."
590,"No time for pleasantries!

We have a crisis at the House of Plagues! (Well, another crisis...)

Kevin caused it, of course. His constant flaunting of hats and showboating of balancing skills has sent the nearby colossal goos into a rampage!

They're stomping right toward us, no doubt to smash everything in sight! None of us will survive!

As my apprentice you must carry on my work and--

I had Au'larrynar bring in some Azerothian refreshments for you. Rencissa smashed them all because you took so long, but ol' Marcel Mullby's still got plenty of lukewarm tauralus milk.

As requested: a status report for the Bleak Redoubt.

The Undying Army's position here remains strong.

Bladeguards hold the north gate and walls, while our summoners work to pull in a powerful ally.

The western entrance is our weak spot, but the soldiers there are not giving up. We should be able to hold it.

Your friend and comrade in arms,
Alexandros Mograine"
597,"Dear $p,

I do so enjoy our correspondence. However, you should know better than to ask after such sensitive information through an unsecured mailing system such as this.

If you need answers to those questions immediately, I shall send Khaliiq to deliver them to you in person.

A better alternative, however, would simply be for you to come visit me at the Renounced Bastille.

I much prefer face-to-face interactions.

Always watching,

Thank you for passing along that intriguing bit of intelligence in your last letter. Mekkar has filed it away in our records. I have no doubt that it will prove quite useful one day.

Allow me to return the favor. Anzio The Infallible at the Theater of Pain is anything but his namesake.

In fact, I have heard that he is no longer allowed onto the arena floor because of his frequent errors in battle. Banned by Grandmaster Vole himself.

You need not waste your time detailing your activities in Maldraxxus. Although I appreciate the thoroughness of your recent letter, you may rest assured that if it happened in Maldraxxus, I am already aware of it.

Still, it is quite endearing that are you so willing to be open with me about your activities. I suppose we are friends now, are we not?

Well, it appears that is one thing happening in Maldraxxus that I did not foresee.

Always watching,
Baroness Vashj"
601,"I do hope you did not think I died within Zereth Mortis. I would apologize, but what is a fake death between working partners?

My plans went off without a ""hitch"" as you mortals say.

Thanks to your help, I was able to create a device in Zereth Mortis that allows me to travel the cosmos.

I am no longer bound to the Maw, and now Cartel Ve will believe I am dead. 

There is an entire existence for me to explore with plenty of opportunities. In fact, I met someone named Xolartios who has offered to serve as my guide.

I am sure we will meet again when I have need of a reliable asset.

Regards,
Ve'nari"
602,"Hello, $n!

It's been a little while since you helped out in the garden, so I thought I'd let you know how my Lifecalling was going.

It's hard but satisfying work, and the plants are all doing well! I'm growing a new type of dragonflower that the fireflies seem to really love.  Keshki is pleased about that of course.

The animals continue to sing thanks in no small part to you! You're always welcome to come sit by the pond and listen--and sample the harvest too!

Don't forget to stop and smell the roses,
Garden Warden Akora"
603,"Hello $n, it's Lasztak.

I wanted to say thank you again for helping us with our bee problem at the Life Pools nursery. The children have been asking about you, but... I think they think you're a magic bee minder of some sort.

Unfortunately, this has become some of game for them, and the whelps have started chasing the remaining bees around since they saw you do it, which is... troublesome. But that's not your fault in the slightest.

You brought them a lot of joy, and that brings ME joy, so please come back anytime.

Sincerely,
Whelptender Lasztak"
604,"Howdy, $n!

I wanted to thank you again for helping me save the hornstriders from those elementals. My first calling got off to a rocky start, but now I've got a jar full of salve and plenty of hornstrider chicks to tend to!

All these little droplets keep coming down from the top of the spring. Maybe one day you can stop these troublemakers at their source! I look forward to seeing you when that time comes.

Happy Trails and Tails,
Dazakros, Caretaker of Hornstriders"
605,"Hi, $n. How's it going?

I hope you're travels have led you to help more people and do more great things! The frogs are doing really well since you helped them. We got the Hornswogs to behave in Hornswog Hollow, and now there's always frogs hopping back and forth from the hollow to the pools. The exercise is really good for them.

If you want to stop by and say hello to the frogs, or to Akora and me, it's always good to see you. Otherwise, I hope your adventures are going well.

See You Around,
Frogminder Keshki

P.S. The frogs say hi! Well, they say ribbit, but that means hi!"
606,"Heya pal! The name's Mizzen, and I hear you're pretty good at findin' stuff.

See, I've been playin' this new game called Warcraft Rumble but I'm fresh outta coins.

How about we meet up and I'll tell you where to find some?"
607,"$n! I've made a breakthrough with tha Winterpelt dialect. Ya helped get tha ball rollin' on this, so I felt like I ought ta keep ya apprised of the situation.

Meet me in Theron's Watch in the Azure Span and I'll tell ya all about it.

608,"Hello, $n. I've been thinking about your last visit. I thought you might know where Kalecgos is, given your friendship with him. He is difficult to locate nowadays.

You, on the other hand! Why, any messenger knows of your name by now. Next time we meet, I'd like to hear more about your worldly adventures.

Whenever you feel the time is right, could you please give this letter to Kalecgos? I hope to see you both soon again.

610,"$n,

Maiev told me of her mission's success--and your aid.

Never forget, you are more than a defender. Your presence serves as an inspiration to those around you, bringing our people together. It is this that marks you as the most honored of Elune. And it is for this that you will always be treasured.

Maiev is right. We cannot stand forever in the traditions of old. We must continue to evolve, as the world evolves around us.

To that end, she recommended Lysander as a potential recruit for the Sentinels. I am reaching out to him to offer the position myself. If our Warden sees such promise in him, he must be someone special. 

After all, she saw the same promise in you.

Rest well, Ama'shan.
